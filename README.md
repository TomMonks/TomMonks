## Reproducible Research in Healthcare AI and Data Science

I am an academic researcher and software engineer with a passion for improving healthcare service delivery (e.g. managing a emergency department or reducing delayed discharges from hospital) using mathematical modelling, AI, and open science. My expertise spans computer simulation, reproducibility, and the development of impactful, shareable computational tools. 

I've also been working hard to increase my skills in AI particularly around Autonomous Agents to interact with data science tools and Large Language Models for coding and reasoning.

## Impact of my work

üëâ I believe that data science can make a huge difference to health services and patient outcomes. For example, 

* [my work in hyper-acute stroke care led to four times as many patients being treated in half the time.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211692314200348)
* [my work in using simulation to reduce delayed transfers of care saves the NHS an estimated ¬£3.2m per year](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17477778.2019.1664264#abstract) üí∞üí∞üí∞
* [during the early stage of Covid-19 pandemic I worked with colleagues to support the NHS make rapid decisions in order to maintain treatment of vulerable patients with renal failure](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237628)

üëâ I believe that open and reproducible health data science leads to less research waste and better patient outcomes: 

* [my work developing reporting guidelines for simulation has helped 100's of authors improve the document their simulation studies](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=0DFB5iYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=0DFB5iYAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC)
* [I'm actively working to support simulation researchers adopt Free and Open Source Software and build reusable model](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience)
